# Cerebellum

## Meta-analysis on cerebellar volumes and areas between individuals with ASD and controls

To make the meta-analysis and generate the figures, source the file `meta-analysis.R` in a R session.<br>
The studies have to be listed in the file `means-[roi].txt` containing the required fields with the variable `suffix` set to `[roi]`.

The `p-curve.R` code was adapted from the source of the p-curve app: `http://p-curve.com/app4/app 4.05.r` by Uri Simonsohn, Leif D. Nelson and Joseph P. Simmons.
